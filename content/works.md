# About Me

hi, you may know me as sleepy, somnus or even lavender_overflow.

i'm 20 and i like dumb pieces of restrained code named smart contracts :3. i also like to hack things (smart contracts included). i'm a privacy maxi.

i've been hacking (professionally) for ~3 years now. here are some cool places i worked at:

- security auditor at [ConsenSys Diligence](https://consensys.io/diligence/), recruited fresh out of high school - jan 2022 to feb 2023
- security researcher at [Spearbit](https://spearbit.com/) april 2022 - present (contractor, currently inactive)
- security advisor at [Vulcanic Labs](https://twitter.com/vulcaniclabs) - may 2023 to mar 2024
- stealth founder (read unemployed :p) - jun 2023 to april 2024 (two security adjacent projects (on pause) and various side material)

i do consulting at [plainshift](https://plainshift.io/), where i am a cofounder.

interested in learning smart contract security?

i wrote a guide a couple years ago on what to learn in a semi-structured format. while outdated, it is still a solid foundation today.

find it [here](https://medium.com/immunefi/hacking-the-blockchain-an-ultimate-guide-4f34b33c6e8b)

also join [skidsdao](https://discord.gg/vJUDgxcBn2), that's the best way to reach me if you'd like my help learning. i'm VERY busy these days though so there's a decent chance i might not have the time :(
