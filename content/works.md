# About Me

Hi, I'm Sleepy aka 0xsomnus. I'm a 20 yo hacker and tinkerer.

My interests currently lie in smart contract dev and security, MEV, and a little smidge of storytelling through CTFs and games.

I've been in the Ethereum smart contract security industry for ~2 years now. I started learning about security and pentesting in general in August 2021 and Ethereum security specifically in November 2021. Here's a short summary of what I've done professionally.

- Security Researcher/Auditor at [ConsenSys Diligence](https://consensys.io/diligence/), recruited fresh out of high school - January 2022 to February 2023
- Security Researcher at [Spearbit](https://spearbit.com/) to April 2022 - Present (Contractor, currently inactive)
- Security Advisor at [Vulcanic Labs](https://twitter.com/vulcaniclabs) - May 2023 to March 2024 (Contractor)
- Stealth Founder - June 2023 to April 2024 (Two security adjacent projects(on pause) and various side material)

I'm also currently offering security auditing and consulting services both independently and as part of the teams I'm currently affiliated with. Please contact me via X for any queries.

If you'd like to see a sample of my work. I've made a few reports public on my GitHub. Unfortunately, this excludes my work in Diligence as the reports have my real world identity on them.

Interested in learning smart contract security?

I wrote a guide a couple years ago on what to learn in a semi-structured format. While outdated, it is still a solid foundation today.
